# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

## Green Belt

You qualified for a Green Belt 🥋🟢 and got a final grade of 4.97/6 for M2. Great job! You're building solid foundations.

| **Consistent Delivery of Value**         | 5 out of 6 | 10%      | [See Details](#consistent-delivery-of-value) |
| **Final Grade**                          | **4.97 out of 6**   |            |                                           |

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

- The profile update feature is currently broken and needs to be fixed as a priority.

- There are many magic values throughout the codebase. These should be removed and replaced with clearly defined constants.

- We also noticed a large number of hard-coded strings. These should be extracted into a dedicated resource or constants file to improve maintainability and localization readiness.

- The APK is not signed. Make sure to sign it properly and ensure that the CI pipeline generates the signed APK automatically.

For this part, you received 4.9 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

- The sign-in feature is currently broken because the APK was not signed. This prevented proper testing of the Google authentication flow.

- While we were able to test some other features, testing was very limited due to the inability to verify communication between Google and the app. Please ensure the APK is properly signed in the CI so that all features, especially authentication, can be fully tested.

For this part, you received 4.66 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

- The Figma design should be ahead of your app development. Plan and design future features in advance to make implementation smoother and more efficient.

- In your Architecture Diagram, make sure to clearly mark that the last row represents the API repositories. This will improve clarity and help the team understand the structure of your codebase.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

- Some user stories in your product backlog are missing a priority. Make sure every story has a clear priority to help the team plan effectively.

- You should consistently specify both the task type and the priority for all tasks. This ensures clarity and proper organization.

- Add detailed descriptions for technical tasks in your issues. Some issues currently have vague titles, so it’s important to clarify exactly what is expected from each student.

For this part, you received 4.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.



For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

- During Sprint 4, some of the work completed was partially undone. We understand that the midterms had a significant impact, but better planning ahead of time could have helped mitigate this. Ensure future sprints account for such interruptions to maintain consistent progress.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M2 is 4.97/6. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Keep up the good work and good luck for the next milestone!
