# 📍 Treasure Hunt App

The **Treasure Hunt App** is a mobile application built around the excitement of discovery.  
It lets players explore their surroundings through location-based treasure hunts — combining culture, outdoor activity, and fun.


---

## 🎯 Concept

Each hunt consists of:
- A **starting point (A)**  
- An **ending point (E)**  
- Multiple **steps/checkpoints** in between  

Players advance by physically reaching GPS coordinates, where clues or tasks are unlocked.  
Hunts can be created, shared, and stored in the cloud for everyone to enjoy.
